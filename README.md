# YomiChess

For testing purposes, a new folder has been added called "Builds", which will contain one or multiple different builds to try out executions of the Unity compiler without the need of importing the proyect to Unity itself.

Also, you can open more than one instance of the build to test connectivity related issues.

Execute the .exe inside "Builds" and it'll run like any program.
